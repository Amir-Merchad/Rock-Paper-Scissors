## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a two-page website with consistent UI/UX
- Clean separation between game logic and UI rendering
- Handling multiple types of game logic (AI vs player, etc.)
- Creating a fully custom mouse cursor and syncing it with DOM interaction
- Using modern CSS (flexbox/grid/variables) to build scalable layouts
- Writing modular, readable JavaScript with reusability in mind
- Managing browser storage and user flow between different HTML pages
- Testing and debugging JavaScript logic with DevTools
